## Task
The objective of this project involved extracting distinctive features from music spanning 10 diverse genres, with the aim of developing a predictive model to identify the genre classification.

## Description
To address this challenge, I employed a set of Python modules, comprising:

1. The 'os' module to manage audio file handling.
2. The 'Librosa' and 'matplotlib' modules for feature extraction and visualization of audio files.
3. The 'numpy' module to facilitate mathematical operations on arrays.
4. The 'json' module for preserving audio file features.
5. The 'sci-kit learn' module for partitioning data into training and testing subsets.
6. The 'Tensorflow' module to design and implement the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Installation
No installation is required for this project. Nevertheless, to effectively run this project, ensure that the 'Librosa' and 'Tensorflow' modules are installed.

## Usage
This project was written on google collab.
